# Student Performance Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
In today's fast-paced and competitive educational environment, understanding the factors that influence student success is crucial. This project takes a deep dive into a dataset called `student_performance`, containing rich details about various aspects of student life such as hours studied, sleep patterns, attendance, and more. The goal is to uncover what truly impacts exam performance and provide actionable insights for students, teachers, and policymakers.

## 📌 Objectives
- Identify key drivers of student success.
- Analyze the impact of study hours and extracurricular activities on exam scores.
- Explore study hour ranges and their correlation with performance.
- Assign student ranks based on exam performance using window functions.

## 🌟 Insights
- Students who studied more than 10 hours weekly and participated in extracurriculars showed higher average exam scores.
- There seems to be a 'sweet spot' for study hours, where too few or too many hours may not be optimal.
- Class rankings provide motivation and a sense of competition without compromising student privacy.

## ✨ Future Enhancements
- Integrate visualizations for deeper insights.
- Explore additional factors like parental involvement or socioeconomic status.
- Build a predictive model to forecast student success based on these parameters.
